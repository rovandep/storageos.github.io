# StorageOS Volume Guide

As a simple first use of StorageOS with {{ page.platform-pretty }} following the example below will create
a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and schedule a Pod to mount the PersistentVolume
(PV) provisioned by the PVC. 

## Creating the PersistentVolumeClaim

1. You can find the latest files in the StorageOS example deployment repository
    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/storageos/deploy.git storageos
    ```
    PVC definition

    {% include platforms/pvc.md %}

    The above PVC will dynamically provision a 5GB volume using the fast
    StorageClass. This StorageClass was created during the StorageOS install
    and causes StorageOS to provision a PersistentVolume. 

{% if page.platform == "azure-aks" %}

    For installations with CSI, you can create multiple StorageClasses to
    specify default labels.

    {% include platforms/csi-sc.md %}

    The above StorageClass has the `storageos.com/replicas` label set. This label tells
    StorageOS to create a replica for the volume that is created. For the sake
    of keeping this example simple the unreplicated volume will be used.

    {% include platforms/csi-pvc.md %}

{% else %}

    {% include platforms/pvc-replica.md %}

    The above PVC has the `storageos.com/replicas` label set. This label tells
    StorageOS to create a replica for the volume that is created. For the sake
    of keeping this example simple the unreplicated volume will be used.

1.  Move into the examples folder and create a PVC using the PVC definition above. 
    ```bash
    $ cd storageos
    $ {{ page.cmd }} create -f ./k8s/examples/pvc.yaml
     ```
    You can view the PVC that you have created with the command below
    ```bash
    $ {{ page.cmd }} get pvc
    NAME         STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
    my-vol-1     Bound    pvc-f8ffa027-e821-11e8-bc0b-0ac77ccc61fa   5Gi        RWO            fast           1m
    ```
1. Create a pod that mounts the PVC created in step 2. 

    ```bash
    $ {{ page.cmd }} create -f ./k8s/examples/debian-pvc.yaml
    ```
    The command above creates a Pod that uses the PVC that was created in step 1. 
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: d1
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: debian
          image: debian:9-slim
          command: ["/bin/sleep"]
          args: [ "3600" ]
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /mnt
              name: v1
      volumes:
        - name: v1
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: my-vol-1
    ```
    In the Pod definition above the volume v1, which references the PVC created
    in step 2, is mounted in the pod at /mnt. In this example a debian image is
    used for the container but any container image with a shell would work for
    this example.

1. Confirm that the pod is up and running
    ```bash 
    $ {{ page.cmd }} get pods
    NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    d1        1/1     Running   0          1m
    ```

1. Execute a shell inside the container and write some contents to a file
    ```bash
    $ {{ page.cmd }} exec -it d1 -- bash 
    root@d1:/# echo "Hello World!" > /mnt/helloworld
    root@d1:/# cat /mnt/helloworld
    Hello World!
    ```
    By writing to /mnt inside the container, the StorageOS volume created by
    the PVC is being written to. If you were to kill the pod and start it again
    on a new node, the helloworld file would still be avaliable.
