# Maintenance

## Node Maintenance

## Draining a node

Draining a node reschedules volumes to other nodes and marks the node as
unschedulable.

* If the volume does not have any replicas, a new replica will be created on a
different node and promoted to master. The previous master will be removed.

* If the volume has replicas, one will be promoted to master. The previous master
will become a replica and be relocated to a different node.

* If there are not enough available nodes, StorageOS will keep trying to evict all
volumes while the node is in the drained state. Once a new node is added to the
cluster, the volume will be moved automatically.

Performing a node drain will not remove the StorageOS mounts living in that
node. Any volume mounted in that specific node will be evicted but still hold
the StorageOS mount making the data transparently available to the client, with
zero downtime.

To drain a node you can use the GUI (see the image below) or the StorageOS CLI
```bash
$ storageos node drain node01
node01
```

## Cordoning a node

Cordoning a node marks the node as unschedulable without rescheduling any
volumes running on the node. New volumes are unable to be scheduled nor can replicas
be promoted on cordoned nodes.

To cordon a node you can use the StorageOS CLI
```bash
$ storageos node cordon node01
node01
```

Or using the GUI go to Nodes and use the cordon toggle.

## Cluster Maintenance Mode

Entering Cluster maintenance mode, or freezing a StorageOS cluster means that
no volumes will be moved, or replicas promoted while the cluster is frozen.

In order to enter cluster maintenance mode you can either use the GUI or the
StorageOS API. 

Using the GUI go to Cluster and toggle Cluster Maintenance Mode on:

To enter Cluster maintenance mode using the API you can post to the following
endpoint:
```bash
$ curl -u storageos:storageos -X POST 10.1.10.165:5705/v1/cluster/maintenance
{"enabled":true,"updatedBy":"storageos","updatedAt":"2018-11-13T15:57:34.605480403Z"}%
```

To leave Cluster maintenance mode using the API you can delete from the
following endpoint:
```bash
$ curl -u storageos:storageos -X DELETE 10.1.10.165:5705/v1/cluster/maintenance
{"enabled":false,"updatedBy":"storageos","updatedAt":"2018-11-13T15:59:09.115797194Z"}%  
```
