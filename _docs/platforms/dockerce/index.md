# Docker CE

While not suitable for production deployments, it is possible to run StorageOS
in a standalone [DockerCE](https://www.docker.com) container, and provide
permanent storage for other containers. This can be useful for testing and
experimentation with our product.

StorageOS also supports Docker EE for production workloads, documented
[here]({%link _docs/platforms/dockeree/index.md %}).
