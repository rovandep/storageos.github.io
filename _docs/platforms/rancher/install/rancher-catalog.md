# Rancher Catalog install

StorageOS is a Certified application in the [Rancher
Catalog](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/catalog/). You can install
StorageOS using the Rancher application install.

1. Select the `System` project of your cluster

    ![install-1](/images/rancher-ui-green-bubbles/rancher-1.png)

1. Select the `Apps` tab and click `Launch`
    ![install-2](/images/rancher-ui-green-bubbles/rancher-2.png)

1. Search for StorageOS and click on the App
    ![install-3](/images/rancher-ui-green-bubbles/rancher-3.png)

1. Define the StorageOS cluster installation

    > A generic configuration for StorageOS is preset using the default values in
    > the form. The values in the form can be changed to customize the
    > installation. To customize the installation further, set `Install StorageOS
    > Cluster` to false and use a [yaml definition for the StorageOSCluster
    > Custom
    > Resource](/docs/platforms/rancher/install/rancher-catalog#custom-resource-definition).

    &nbsp;

    The following options are exposed by the form to allow some simple
    customization of the StorageOS installation.
    - [Cluster Operator]({%link _docs/reference/cluster-operator/index.md %}) namespace
    : The Kubernetes namespace where the StorageOS Cluster Operator controller
    and other resources will be created.
    - Container Images
    : By default images are pulled from DockerHub, you can specify the image URLs
    when using private registries.
    - Conditional bootstrap of StorageOS 
    : Controls the automatic deployment of StorageOS after installing the
    Cluster Operator. If set to `false`, the Operator will be created, but the
    Custom Resource will not be applied to the cluster. Launch the operator and
    proceed to the section [Custom Resource
    definition](#custom-resource-definition). For more information check the
    Operator [documentation]({%link
    _docs/reference/cluster-operator/configuration.md %}) and [CR
    examples]({%link _docs/reference/cluster-operator/examples.md %}).
    - StorageOS namespace
    : The Kubernetes namespace where StorageOS will be installed. Installing
    into the `kube-system` namespace will add StorageOS to a priority class to
    ensure high priority resource allocation. Installing StorageOS with the
    priority class prevents StorageOS from being evicted during periods of
    resource contention.
    - Username/Password
    : Default Username and Password for the admin account to be created at
    StorageOS bootstrap. A random password will be generated by leaving the
    field empty or clicking the `Generate` button.
    - Key-value store [setup]({%link _docs/operations/external-etcd/index.md %})
    : Connection and configuration details for an external Etcd cluster.
    StorageOS can use an external key-value store to hold configuration.
    Settings such as external etcd with TLS termination are available.
    - Node Selectors and Tolerations
    : Control placement of StorageOS DaemonSet Pods. StorageOS will only be installed
    on the selected nodes. Can be used in conjunction with tolerations.

1. Verify the cluster bootstrap has successfully completed

## Custom Resource definition

If `Install StorageOS Cluster` was set to `false`, StorageOS will not be
bootstrapped automatically. After the StorageOS Operator is installed, you can
now create a Custom Resource that describes the StorageOS cluster.

1. Select the `System Workloads` and `Import YAML`
    ![install-7](/images/rancher-ui-green-bubbles/rancher-7.png)

1. Create the `Secret` and `CustomResource`
