# Rancher

This section of documentation covers use of the
[Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) orchestrator as a Kubernetes provisioner.

## Rancher with StorageOS

StorageOS installation in Rancher deployed clusters is fully supported.

Kubernetes API controller and StorageOS communicate with each other to perform
actions such as creation, deletion or mounting of volumes. The standard
communication procedure uses REST API calls. However, StorageOS also implements
communication using CSI. By using CSI, Kubernetes and StorageOS communicates
via a Linux socket. That socket is handled by the Kubelet in the Host.

## CSI (Container Storage Interface) Note

CSI is the future standard that enables storage drivers to release on their own
schedule. This allows storage vendors to upgrade, update, and enhance their drivers 
without the need to update Kubernetes source code, or follow Kubernetes release
cycles.

CSI 1.0.0 is released with Kubernetes 1.13. Its use is recommended only if
the user is aware of its particularities. 

> CSI communication between StorageOS and Kubernetes is currently not possible
> when using __RancherOS__ because of restricted access to the Linux Socket created by the
> Kubelet. 

CSI communication is fully supported by StorageOS if the Kubernetes cluster is
deployed with another supported Linux Distribution.
