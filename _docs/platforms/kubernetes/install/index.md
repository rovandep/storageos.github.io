# Kubernetes

This section of documentation covers use of the vanilla
[kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) orchestrator. The StorageOS installation
procedure is slightly different depending on the version you have deployed, so
follow the appropriate guide. Other documents in this section are version
agnostic.
