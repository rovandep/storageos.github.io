# Kubernetes

This section of documentation covers use of the vanilla [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) 
orchestrator. The StorageOS installation procedure is slightly different depending 
on the version you have deployed, so follow the appropriate guide. Other documents
in this section are version agnostic.

## Kubernetes with StorageOS

Kubernetes and StorageOS communicate with each other to perform actions such as
creation, deletion or mounting volumes. The standard communication procedure uses REST
API calls. However, StorageOS also implements communication using CSI. By 
using CSI, Kubernetes and StorageOS communicate over a Unix domain socket. That
socket is handled by the Kubelet in the Host.

## CSI (Container Storage Interface) Note

CSI is the future standard that enables storage drivers to release on their own
schedule. This allows storage vendors to upgrade, update, and enhance their drivers 
without the need to update Kubernetes source code, or follow Kubernetes release
cycles.

CSI is available from Kubernetes 1.9 alpha. As CSI is still not GA in
Kubernetes, StorageOS recommends it is only used if the user is aware of its
limitations and understands that non-GA versions of an active project might contain
breaking changes.

Check out the status of the CSI release cycle in relation with Kubernetes in
the [CSI project](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/) page.

StorageOS leverages labels in PVCs to apply [features]({%link
_docs/reference/labels.md %}) to StorageOS volumes. However, StorageOS doesn't
have these labels set when using CSI. Therefore, default feature labels
(`storageos.com/*`) must be defined on the Kubernetes StorageClass parameters.
Multiple StorageClasses can be defined with different parameters. The
[StorageOS CLI]({%link _docs/reference/cli/index.md %}) can also manipulate
volume labels or create [rules]({%link _docs/reference/cli/rule.md %}) to
add/delete labels on StorageOS volumes.
